Lerant concept as Client Script.
What is client script?
Client-side scripts execute within a user's browser and are used to manage forms and form fields. 
API used in client script: g_form, g_user.
Examples of things client-side scripts can do include:
Place the cursor in a form field on form load
Generate alerts, confirmations, and messages
Populate a form field in response to another field's value
Highlight a form field
Validate form data
Modify choice list options
Hide/Show fields or sections.
Types of client script:
Onload(): Script will runs when the system first renders the form and before users can enter data.
               Used when something needs to be changed on the form while it is loading.
               onLoad() function will be automatically populated in the script field when onload() type is selected on the form.
               Typically, onLoad()client scripts perform client-side-manipulation of the current form or set default record values.
               function: onLoad(){
               
               }
onChange():Script will runs when a particular field value changes on the form.
            Used to perform some operation as per the field changed
            onChange() function will be automatically populated in the script field when onChange  type is selected on the form.
            The onChange()client script must specify these parameters.
            control: the DHTML widget whose value changed
            function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) {
            if (isLoading || newValue === '') {
            return;
            }
            }

onCellEdit():Script will runs when a field value changes on a list.
             The onCellEdit() client script must specify these parameters.
             sysIDs: hold all the value of the sys_ids for all items being edited.
             table: the table of the items being edited.
             oldValues: the old values of the cells being edited.
             newValue: the new value for the cells being edited.
             callback: a callback that continues the execution of any other related cell edit scripts. If true is passed as a parameter, the other scripts are executed or the change is committed if there are no more scripts. If false is passed as a parameter, any further scripts are not executed and the change is not committed.
             function onCellEdit(sysIDs, table, oldValues, newValue, callback) {
             var saveAndClose = true;
             callback(saveAndClose);
             }

onSubmit():Script will runs when a form is submitted or saved.
           onSubmit() function will be automatically populated in the script field when onSubmit type is selected on the form
           Typically, onSubmit() scripts validate things on the form and ensure that the submission makes sense. An onSubmit() client script can cancel form submission by returning a value of false.
           function onSubmit() {
           
           }
