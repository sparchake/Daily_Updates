##POC statement for flow designer:
Functionality Overview:
->When the user selects "Yes," the workflow initiates a process that involves manager approval followed by catalog creation.
->If the user selects "No," the workflow bypasses manager approval and directly proceeds to catalog task creation.

t##Technical Implementation:

->Upon selecting "Yes," the system triggers a workflow that includes a manager approval step, managed through ServiceNow's workflow engine.
->Once manager approval is granted, the workflow transitions to a subsequent stage for catalog creation, leveraging ServiceNow's catalog creation capabilities.
->In the event of selecting "No," the workflow logic skips the manager approval step, directing the process immediately to catalog task creation.
->This workflow logic is implemented using ServiceNow's Flow Designer or Workflow Editor, with conditional branches based on user input.

Workflow Steps:

User Input: User selects "Yes" or "No."
Conditional Branching:
->If "Yes" is selected:
    ->Initiates manager approval workflow.
Upon approval, proceeds to catalog creation.
    ->If "No" is selected:
Skips manager approval.
Directly proceeds to catalog task creation.
